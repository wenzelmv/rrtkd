            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Grand Master Jim Grimestad is the highest ranking black belt in the FM area. He is the only instructor to travel to Korea for training and testing. 
                Grand Master Jim Grimestad began taking classes under 10th Degree Great Grand Master Moo Yong Yun when he was 11 years old. He is a a certified 
                8th Degree Grand Master from the World TaeKwonDo Federation, certified 8th Degree Grand Master in Moo Duk Kwan TaeKwonDo, 
                a certified 7th Degree Grand Master in Chang Moo Kwan TaeKwonDo, a certified 5th Degree Master Instructor in HapKido and a certified 4th Degree Master Instructor 
                in KumDo (Korean art of the sword). Great Grand Master Yun was taught the martial arts as a young man in Korea and used them growing-up in post-war Seoul. 
                In the military as on officer in the Vietnam War he trained and fought daily using technique meant for killing not scoring points. 
                Great Grand Master Yun moved to the U.S. in 1974 and began teaching the art that was now called "TaeKwonDo".  We teach TaeKwonDo in this manner, meant for the real world, unfiltered for sport. 
                In fighting there is a winner, in self-defense there is a survivor. Traditional TaeKwonDo is for self-perfection as well as self-protection. 
                You will challenge yourself every class and see the differences in yourself physically as well as in your life.
                Great Grand Master Yun began teaching here in Fargo in 1974. He was the pioneer of TaeKwonDo in the state. TaeKwonDo does not have an "official" curriculum that all 
                schools teach but many schools in the area are the result of students who have broken away from Great Grand Master Yun and took some of his technique with them. 
                If your gym teaches 21 Movement, 30 Working Series, Advanced One Steps, 3-2-1 Steps, Face Contact, Combination Kicks etc. they came from Great Grand Master Yun's curriculum.
